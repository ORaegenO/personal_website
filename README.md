personal website
My personal website!! I'm actually pretty proud of this! 
I figured out how to override Bootstrap for the background color of the navbar. The format changes depending on the size of the screen from seeing all the tabs to a collapsible accordion. So yes, the site is responsive.

The tabs in the navbar will take you to the appropriate place in the site. PResently the options in the project dropdown are just placeholders.

The links for YouTube and GitHub work.
I couldn't figure out how to change the font color of the YouTube and Git Hub links and I was unable to put a background color on the container that they're in. but that's ok.

I figured out the carousel! And yes, the buttons work there too.
And the finishing touch - make sure to check out the favicon!

Thank you!!
