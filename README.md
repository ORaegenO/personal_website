personal website
My personal website 2.0!! 
I couldn't figure out how to get the dropdown projects menu to go to each of the projects - I may have even left the tags on. Prject-one sort of works.
I fiddled with the contact me form but until I have a proper backend I decided to leave it.
When I actually get some real projects I'll probably ditch the carousel in favour of something stationary but I right now I still like it.
I'm pretty pleased with the parallax effect - It took some playing around to get everything to fit properly in the containers. And I like how each swipe will give one full view of each picture.
Thank you!!
